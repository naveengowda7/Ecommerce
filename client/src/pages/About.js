                        <p>
                            Infinity Cart was born out of a simple idea:
                            <strong> empower individuals to trade seamlessly</strong>.
                            We envisioned a space where people could find value in the things they no longer needed
                            and discover hidden gems at affordable prices. Our journey began in 2024.
                            Since then, we've been committed to providing a safe, user-friendly environment for all.
